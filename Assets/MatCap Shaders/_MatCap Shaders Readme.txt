MatCap Shaders Pack v1.1
2013/04/19
(c) 2013, Jean Moreno
========================

This is a pack of MatCap-like shaders, used in popular 3d software such as ZBrush or Sculptris.
They allow to determine the whole shading model of an object with a single texture without using any lights.
As such the shaders are really fast and should work very well on mobile!

They are based on the MatCap shader by Daniel Brauer, from the Unify Community: http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/MatCap
Optimizations have been made to make them much faster, and to add some features such as adding a regular texture on top of the matcap one.

"Vertex" are the defaults shader, where most of the calculations are done per-vertex, so they are very fast.
"Bumped" are shaders with normap map support, with more calculations being made per-pixel, and as such are slower.
